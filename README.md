# TN_tutorial

This is a tutorial of tensor network (TN) methods, as a part of a course "Computational Physics" for the graduated students in Capital Normal University, Beijing China. A more advanced version of the lecture notes can be found in Springer Open-access (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34489-4)

The aim of the course is to explain the mathematic foundation of TN and its connections to quantum many-body physics from the very beginning. The audiences are expected to include the undergraduate and graduate students in physics, and those who study/work in computer sciences and applied mathematics.

As the course is mainly for Chinese students, many comments are in Chinese. I haven’t translated them all to English, but will if necessary.
